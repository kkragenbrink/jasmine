### How Commands are Handled
All commands pass through the Interpreter, which consists of a series of
regular expression command lists.  The Interpreter goes through each command
list, testing until it finds a match.  When a match is found, the Interpreter
hands off evaluation of the command to the appropriate handler, then stops
searching.

Each command list has an collective rule which determines whether that list
should be tested at all, as well as a priority to determine in what order
the list should be tested.  Lower numbered priorities are more important.

An individual command is, therefore, tested according to the following set
of rules (in order):
  1. If the session is in CONNECTING status, the login command list is
      checked.
  2. If any custom command lists have been defined (see below), they are
      checked by ascending priority.
  3. The general command list is checked.
  4. The command is treated as an unhandled command, and the session receives
      a "failed" event.

#### Custom Command Lists
Custom command lists can be defined.

```javascript
Interpreter.addList(<name>[, <priority>, <test>]);
```

  * **name** (String) The name of the command list (can be used to fetch a
      command list which already exists)
  * **priority** (Integer) The list's priority.  A lower number means it will
      be checked sooner.
  * **test** (Function) A boolean to determine whether the command list is
      appropriate for the current situation.

By default, the following command lists are defined:
  * _login_: Handles commands while Session.CONNECTING === TRUE.
  * _general_: Generic command list while Session.CONNECTED === TRUE.

Some additional command lists which might make sense, but are not defined by default:
  * "Personal" lists. (Aliases, Channel Aliases, etc.)
  * "Local" or "Room" lists.
  * "Nearby" lists.
  * "Zone" lists.

#### Adding a command to a list
Commands are added to lists as a regex and a handler.

```javascript
Interpreter.addCommand(<test>, <handler>[, <list>]);
```

  * **test** (RegExp) A regular expression to match to the command.
  * **handler** (Function) The function to pass off evaluation to on a match.
  * **list** (String) The name of the command list (default: general).
