### How Commands are Handled
All commands pass through the Interpreter, which consists of a series of
regular expression command lists.  The Interpreter goes through each command
list, testing until it finds a match.  When a match is found, the Interpreter
hands off evaluation of the command to the appropriate handler, then stops
searching.

Each command list has an collective rule which determines whether that list
should be tested at all, as well as a priority to determine in what order
the list should be tested.  Lower numbered priorities are more important.

An individual command is, therefore, tested according to the following set
of rules (in order):
  1. If the session is in CONNECTING status, the login command list is
      checked.
  2. If any custom command lists have been defined (see below), they are
      checked by ascending priority.
  3. The general command list is checked.
  4. The command is treated as an unhandled command, and the session receives
      a "failed" event.

#### Custom Command Lists
Custom command lists can be defined at any time.  Calling this method more
than once updates the settings for the command list in question, allowing
commands to be assigned to a list that doesn't yet exist.

```javascript
Interpreter.configure(<list>, <priority>[, <test>]);
```

  * **list** (String) The name of the command list (can be used to fetch a
      command list which already exists)
  * **priority** (Integer) The list's priority, defined as the order in which
      it will be tested. E.g. priority 1 is tested before priority 2.
  * **test** (Function) A boolean to determine whether the command list is
      appropriate for the current situation. This method takes two arguments:
      * **session** (Session) The session which initiated the command.
      * **phrase** (String) The phrase which is going to be handled by a
          command.
      If no test is specified, the list will default to TRUE.

By default, the following command lists are defined:
  * _login_: Handles commands while Session.CONNECTING === TRUE.
  * _general_: Generic command list while Session.CONNECTED === TRUE.

Some additional command lists which might make sense, but are not defined by default:
  * "Personal" lists. (Aliases, Channel Aliases, etc.)
  * "Local" or "Room" lists.
  * "Nearby" lists.
  * "Zone" lists.

#### Adding a command to a list
Commands are added to lists as a regex and a handler.

```javascript
Interpreter.addCommand(<list>, <command>);
```

  * **list** (String) The name of the command list to place the command on.
      If the specified list does not already exist, it will be created using
      the default priority and test.
  * **command** (Command) An implementation of the Command interface, which
      defines the command's structure as well as handles any calls to the
      command.

#### Evaluation
Some commands may have input which is intended to be parsed as code. For
example, most commands which create output will respect substitution codes
such as new line (%r) or tab (%t).

Although any module can add additional parsers, it is generally encouraged
that evaluation of phrases as softcode be done using the default parser.

```javascript
var out = Parser.parse(<session>, <phrase>[, <parser>])
```

  * **session** (Session) The session which created the phrase.
  * **phrase** (Phrase) The phrase which needs to be evaluated.
  * **parser** (String) The name of the parser to invoke. (default: 'default')

Modules can easily extend the softcode parser:

```javascript
Parser.addRule(<rule>[, <parser>])
```

  * **rule** (Rule) The rule to be added.  Rules are an instance of the Rule
      struct found in src/Parser.js:
      * **name** (String) The name of the rule.
      * **test** (RegExp) The tokenizing match for the rule.
      * **handler** (Function) The method to run when the parser encounters
          this rule.
  * **parser** (String) The name of the parser to update. (default: 'default')


#### Recursive Interpretation
_TODO: Explain recursive calls to the command parser; e.g. how the ] command
disengages the sofcode parser, or how the ic command prefixes all output lines
with "(ic)"_
